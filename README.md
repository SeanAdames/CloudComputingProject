Verification that Google Dataflow successfully uploaded our data passed in from our Java script: https://storage.cloud.google.com/dataflow-cloudcomputingdataflow/linecount-00000-of-00001?_ga=2.228040859.-720083893.1649035167&_gac=1.258673528.1649045030.CjwKCAjwi6WSBhA-EiwA6Niok6GATVCoGJBljVJ8VtvwJfeyLIj5qKI0BZwgwkA3wEPyMWkrgm4RLhoC4RIQAvD_BwE

NOTE!! The link above will take users to a webpage containing an output stored in our Google Cloud Storage. The output should read 5525, indicating that our Java function has worked correctly, piped the output through Google Dataflow and successfully stored it in our Cloud Storage. The Google Cloud project will be deleted on June 15 as not overuse data on service.
